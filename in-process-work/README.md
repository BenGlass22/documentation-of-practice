# Emoji Portraits, work in progress

![In_Progress](sketch.png)

- Date: April 29, 2020
- Medium: Digital generated images made via GAN model on Runway.ml. HTML. P5.js creation.
- Description: These images show case the various elements of my overall work in progress. 
The production of the GAN images and photo editing involved. The code written for the p5.js project
as well as a segment of html written for the GANMOJIPEDIA website.

Inspired by themes of image fidelity, GAN art and pictoral comunication in the emerging world of the GAN
I came across the idea of creating GAN generated emojis based on the currently existing 3,304 current IOS Emojis.
Having found an open source model on Runway involving apple emojis I began traning my model feeding it all IOS EMOJIS
and varients as source material. After 3,000 epochs the GAN produced the first series of 100 images to which I am calling 
Gen1, as all batches to follow will learn and evovle based on all subsequent variations and source material. With the images created each one was edited in photoshop through batch a editing process to recognizable eomi size and format. These images where then used in conjunction with the p5.js projects that exist as scripts run on the Gan moji website. Both of which have been buily from scratch.
