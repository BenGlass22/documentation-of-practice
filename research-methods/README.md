- Description: A selection of my GAN research and resources. 

This image is amalgam of varrying sources and resoruces I have encountered in my research. The image of the man is from a source regarding the inventor of the Generative Adversarial network. Among the other sources and examples of Gan you can see a project someone made on github that was instramental in my understanding of the GAN. The project itself is an interactive neural network broken down piece by piece.
